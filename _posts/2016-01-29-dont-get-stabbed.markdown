Dekar’s debut as a T.O. with “Don’t Get Stabbed” was a huge success which was only complimented with the lavish location that is Boronia. The lead up to the tourney was ripe with jokes about Boronia, but the ease of access to everything around the venue and the venue itself was quite exceptional.

The day started off a little shaky though, with a lack of consoles and some people coming late, Dekar was a little worried. But by Teams starting time the turnout was solid, including NSW players Ted and Ricky. Teams for both games were very un-eventful. Ted and Ricky had a straight run to victory in brawl teams, along with Cao and Meteor performing the same in melee, making Ricky the champion in both melee and brawl teams.

Melee singles was given a bit of customization with the stage listing altered by Dekar, adding some more counter-picks and 2 bans to cover some issues caused by the extra stages.. Melee was much closer in comparison to its results for teams. Redact took a set off Cao, making it the first time Cao reach winners finals in a very long time. Cao came back through losers, knocking out Redact in losers finals after swapping back to peach because he believed he couldn’t take on Redact’s Captain Falcon with his Sheik. The grand finals were close from game one, with Cao taking the first set off Dekar 3-2, but losing the second set 3-1, making Dekar the winner of melee singles.

Brawl was not without its upsets either. Both Attila and Tibs turned up too late to play their first games, thus automatically being pushed into losers. Leisha knocked Toshi out of winners, proceeding to winner’s semi finals where she was pushed into losers by the Overall tournament winner Tedeth. Tedeth had a straight run to victory, only losing one game the entire tournament, that being to Jei.

Despite key community figure Jared Atticus “The Understander” Willett being absent, the tournament was a huge success for such a short notice, non-Couch Warriors tournament. Dekar ensured satisfaction with pulling plenty of strings to get an adequate amount of setups to this event, making sure everything could run on time with space for friendlies.
